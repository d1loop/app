## 🚨 Notice
The project is still under heavy development, so it will take some time to publish the first release (or beta release) of **d1loop**. The *planned release date* is 1st July 2023 (which may be delayed due to school projects and Bagruts tests I need to do). You can check out [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/1itsrn) to see previews for the app and updates.

## 🔍 About The Project
Some time ago I looked at the Twitter app and thought about what would happen if I ever had an app similar to Twitter, but 100% anonymous and toxic-less (although some data is being collected, it's not emails or things like that), and that's how I got the idea to the d1loop app.

## 📩 Installing
Choose the platform you want to download the app for:

#### Android
When the app will be released, you can download the `app-release.apk` file from the Releases tab. This app won't be released to the Google Play Store (Because of the ID photos I need to send them to verify me as a developer, on top of one time 25$ payment).

#### iOS
Apple requires me to pay up for a developer account to let iOS users install this app too. In the next few months, iOS 17 is going to be out, and Apple should make it able to install external applications outside of the App Store so it won't require me to pay 99$\year just to release this app for iOS users.
